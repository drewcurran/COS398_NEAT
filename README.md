# COS398_NEAT

## Instructions
To run the program, install the catanatron libraries.
Afterwards, run the training file within the subfolder. 
The command line arguments are specified in the training file.
The files may not immediately import everything, so you may have to change file paths to get them working.
The results can be seen in the Jupyter notebooks.

## Information
All of the code is written by me, with the exception being the catan_simulation.py file which was heavily adapted from catanatron code.
